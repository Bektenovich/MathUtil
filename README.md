# MathUtil

## Description

The MathUtil project is a Java application that provides various advanced numerical operations. It includes methods to perform calculations such as checking for prime numbers, finding GCD and LCM, calculating Fibonacci numbers, factorials, and more. Additionally, it includes methods for non-static operations, such as determining perfect numbers and Armstrong numbers.

## Features

- **Static Methods**:
  - `isPrime(int n)`: Checks if a number is prime.
  - `gcd(int a, int b)`: Calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers.
  - `lcm(int a, int b)`: Computes the least common multiple of two numbers.
  - `fibonacci(int n)`: Returns the nth Fibonacci number.
  - `factorial(int n)`: Calculates the factorial of a number.

- **Non-Static Methods**:
  - `isPerfectNumber(int n)`: Checks if a number is a perfect number.
  - `sumOfDigits(int n)`: Computes the sum of the digits of a number.
  - `reverseNumber(int n)`: Reverses the digits of a number.
  - `isArmstrongNumber(int n)`: Checks if a number is an Armstrong number.
  - `nextPrime(int n)`: Finds the next prime number after a given number.
